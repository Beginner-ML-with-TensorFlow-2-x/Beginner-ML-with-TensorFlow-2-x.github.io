# Presentation

ML4Rookies is a working group of machine learning developers aiming the development of an 
**open**, **updated**, **multi-platform**, and  **early entry** machine learning content. 

## ML4Rookies Vision

We envision reducing the entry barrier understanding and implementing machine-learning, not just for 
computer science students and other technical folks, but also imporantly for those roles not so technical 
but called to play a fundamental role fostering AI.

## ML4Rookies Mission

We command ourselves the development of machine learning texts and interactive course, that's actually kept up-to-date. 
Written by the community, multilingual, and open-source.

# Team

We are a diverse and include team, with people from many diferent countries, speaking several languages and enriched with
many cultural background. You can see the member of our team [here](https://github.com/orgs/ml4rookies/people)
